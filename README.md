# JCoRe Miscellaneous Tools

This is a support project that mainly helps in the creation of new JCoRe projects.
To this end, it offers a range of JCoRe related Maven archetypes that automatically
create the frame for new JCoRe projects.

The JCoRe-scripts help to set UIMA descriptor versions for new releases and creating JCoRe
component parameter tables for new components. A very important script there is
the `createMetaDescriptors.py` script that creates and, on demand, installs meta descriptions
of JCoRe components to use with the [JCoRe Pipeline Builder](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-pipeline-builder-cli).
